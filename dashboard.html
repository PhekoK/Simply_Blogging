                                <p>
                                    Football is arguably the biggest phenomenon in the United Kingdom, just look at the
                                    outcry in the
                                    face of the recent European Super league proposal.
                                    <span id="param1">...</span><span id="more1">
                                        If baseball is America’s pastime, then football
                                        is the UK’s all-the-time. Football in Britain is something to be proud of, with
                                        many proclaiming the
                                        Premier League to be the greatest league in the world, and there is a strong
                                        point to be made to
                                        this affect.
                                        Where this pride has often fallen away, however, is in the face of women’s
                                        football. Not only does
                                        the United Kingdom have a rich men’s footballing history, but it also has a rich
                                        women’s footballing
                                        history too. And whilst many throughout time have done their best to wipe out
                                        and disregard this
                                        fact, we are now finally beginning to see a rebirth of the women’s game.

                                        History
                                        For as long as men have played football, so have women. These roots can be
                                        definitively traced back
                                        at least as far as the late 18th century, when football was a casual affair.

                                        The 19th century saw the introduction of Association football, the rules were
                                        finalized and
                                        standardized and the sport took off. Just as men set up teams, women looked to
                                        also. As women took
                                        more of an interest in football, the resistance to them doing so grew. For them
                                        it was deemed a
                                        hobby; playing for fun was fine but regulating it as a formal sport was not in
                                        the eyes of the
                                        Association.

                                        First Clubs
                                        In the face of this objection, two teams managed to establish themselves, but
                                        they faced harsh
                                        press. Much was aimed at their appearance and their intrusion into a man’s game.
                                        This ugly model has
                                        long informed the dialogue surrounding women and football.

                                        The first club to arise was Mrs. Graham’s XI, established in Scotland in 1881,
                                        by Helen Graham
                                        Matthews. On the 9th of May that year they played their first game, but in just
                                        their second game
                                        they faced violent protest and pitch invasions and were forced to abandon their
                                        project. </span>

                                        the marvelous works of Shakespeare or Byron. If not for the writing language we
                                        wouldn’t be aware of the previous eras, and we would still be leaning on to the
                                        oral
                                        tradition which changes as it is passed. So, language especially the written
                                        language is a cognitive method that is used to express an individual’s thoughts
                                        and
                                        feelings.

                                        Early Roots
                                        The writing which is so important to human beings is assumed to be the first
                                        important skill developed by us. The cave paintings which record the life of
                                        humans
                                        become the earliest example to prove this fact. In fact, it is believed that the
                                        spoken language has evolved tens and thousands of years earlier than the written
                                        language.

                                        Writing may have been invented during three different times in three different
                                        parts
                                        of the world: in the Near East, (roughly corresponded to the modern-day Middle
                                        East)
                                        China, and Mesoamerica. There are also several places such as the Indus River
                                        valley
                                        and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) where writing may have been invented but it remains
                                        undeciphered.

                                        Although these dates suggest that writing could have spread out from one central
                                        point of origin, there is little evidence of any links between these systems,
                                        with
                                        each possessing unique qualities.

                                        Of these three writing systems, only the Mesopotamian cuneiform script, invented
                                        in
                                        Sumer, present-day Iraq, (c. 3200 BC), can be traced without any discontinuity
                                        over
                                        a period of 10,000 years, from a prehistoric antecedent to the present-day
                                        alphabet. </span>

                                <p>Kaspersky on April 26 released survey results revealing that almost one quarter (22
                                    percent) of PCs still run the end-of-life OS Microsoft Windows 7, which stopped
                                    receiving mainstream support in January 2020. <span
                                    id="param4">...</span><span id="more4">

                                    When operating systems reach end of life, vulnerabilities will remain on the system
                                    without patch updates to resolve issues, providing cyberattackers with potential
                                    ways to gain access. Therefore, it is critical to update a system's OS to protect
                                    networks from this avoidable issue, according to Kaspersky.

                                    Using an end-of-life operating system that no longer receives security updates is
                                    akin to driving a car with a brake light on. The likelihood of disaster is great and
                                    yet it is difficult to convey this to users of such systems without it appearing to
                                    be a ploy to get them to spend more money, suggested Oliver Tavakoli, CTO at Vectra
                                    AI.

                                    "This would be a good place for a government or NGOs to step in to provide
                                    incentives and programs to upgrade as it makes the entire ecosystem more secure," he
                                    told TechNewsWorld.

                                    Those still using Windows 7 are consumers, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs),
                                    and very small businesses (VSBs). The survey points out that almost a quarter of
                                    VSBs still use the outdated OS because they lack dedicated IT staff.

                                    A temporary alternative for business users is to purchase extended paid support for
                                    Windows 7 from Microsoft. However, that means an extra expense.

                                    Kaspersky's findings also showed that less than one percent of people and businesses
                                    still use older operating systems, such as Windows XP and Vista. Support for those
                                    more ancient OSes ended in 2014 and 2017 respectively.

                                    That leaves 72 percent of users running Windows 10, the latest version of Windows
                                    OS. </span></p>
