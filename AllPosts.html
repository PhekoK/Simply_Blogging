                    Football is arguably the biggest phenomenon in the United Kingdom, just look at the outcry in the
                    face of the recent European Super league proposal. If baseball is America’s pastime, then football
                    is the UK’s all-the-time. Football in Britain is something to be proud of, with many proclaiming the
                    Premier League to be the greatest league in the world, and there is a strong point to be made to
                    this affect.

                    Where this pride has often fallen away, however, is in the face of women’s football. Not only does
                    the United Kingdom have a rich men’s footballing history, but it also has a rich women’s footballing
                    history too. And whilst many throughout time have done their best to wipe out and disregard this
                    fact, we are now finally beginning to see a rebirth of the women’s game.

                    History
                    For as long as men have played football, so have women. These roots can be definitively traced back
                    at least as far as the late 18th century, when football was a casual affair.

                    The 19th century saw the introduction of Association football, the rules were finalized and
                    standardized and the sport took off. Just as men set up teams, women looked to also. As women took
                    more of an interest in football, the resistance to them doing so grew. For them it was deemed a
                    hobby; playing for fun was fine but regulating it as a formal sport was not in the eyes of the
                    Association.

                    First Clubs
                    In the face of this objection, two teams managed to establish themselves, but they faced harsh
                    press. Much was aimed at their appearance and their intrusion into a man’s game. This ugly model has
                    long informed the dialogue surrounding women and football.

                    The first club to arise was Mrs. Graham’s XI, established in Scotland in 1881, by Helen Graham
                    Matthews. On the 9th of May that year they played their first game, but in just their second game
                    they faced violent protest and pitch invasions and were forced to abandon their project. </p>
