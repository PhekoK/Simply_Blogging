                <h6 id="post-date-author">Posted: by </h6>
            </div>
            <div id="blog-content">
                <p>
                    Football is arguably the biggest phenomenon in the United Kingdom, just look at the outcry in the
                    face of the recent European Super league proposal. If baseball is America’s pastime, then football
                    is the UK’s all-the-time. Football in Britain is something to be proud of, with many proclaiming the
                    Premier League to be the greatest league in the world, and there is a strong point to be made to
                    this affect.

                    Where this pride has often fallen away, however, is in the face of women’s football. Not only does
                    the United Kingdom have a rich men’s footballing history, but it also has a rich women’s footballing
                    history too. And whilst many throughout time have done their best to wipe out and disregard this
                    fact, we are now finally beginning to see a rebirth of the women’s game.

                    History
                    For as long as men have played football, so have women. These roots can be definitively traced back
                    at least as far as the late 18th century, when football was a casual affair.

                    The 19th century saw the introduction of Association football, the rules were finalized and
                    standardized and the sport took off. Just as men set up teams, women looked to also. As women took
                    more of an interest in football, the resistance to them doing so grew. For them it was deemed a
                    hobby; playing for fun was fine but regulating it as a formal sport was not in the eyes of the
                    Association.

                    First Clubs
                    In the face of this objection, two teams managed to establish themselves, but they faced harsh
                    press. Much was aimed at their appearance and their intrusion into a man’s game. This ugly model has
                    long informed the dialogue surrounding women and football.

                    The first club to arise was Mrs. Graham’s XI, established in Scotland in 1881, by Helen Graham
                    Matthews. On the 9th of May that year they played their first game, but in just their second game
                    they faced violent protest and pitch invasions and were forced to abandon their project. </p>

                    Kaspersky on April 26 released survey results revealing that almost one quarter (22 percent)
                    of PCs still run the end-of-life OS Microsoft Windows 7, which stopped receiving mainstream
                    support in January 2020. When operating systems reach end of life, vulnerabilities will remain on
                    the system without patch updates to resolve issues, providing cyberattackers with potential ways to
                    gain access.
                    Therefore, it is critical to update a system's OS to protect networks from this avoidable issue,
                    according to Kaspersky.
                    Using an end-of-life operating system that no longer receives security updates is akin to driving a
                    car with a brake light on.
                    The likelihood of disaster is great and yet it is difficult to convey this to users of such systems
                    without it appearing to be
                    a ploy to get them to spend more money, suggested Oliver Tavakoli, CTO at Vectra AI. "This would be
                    a good place for a
                    government or NGOs to step in to provide incentives and programs to upgrade as it makes the entire
                    ecosystem more secure,
                    " he told TechNewsWorld. Those still using Windows 7 are consumers, small and medium-sized
                    businesses (SMBs), and very small
                    businesses (VSBs). The survey points out that almost a quarter of VSBs still use the outdated OS
                    because they lack dedicated
                    IT staff. A temporary alternative for business users is to purchase extended paid support for
                    Windows 7 from Microsoft.
                    However, that means an extra expense. Kaspersky's findings also showed that less than one percent of
                    people and businesses
                    still use older operating systems, such as Windows XP and Vista. Support for those more ancient OSes
                    ended in 2014 and 2017
                    respectively.
                    That leaves 72 percent of users running Windows 10, the latest version of Windows OS. </p>

                    Cuneiform: The Ancient Art of Writing</h3>
                <h6 id="post-date-author">Posted: by </h6>
            </div>
            <div id="blog-content">
                <p> The world is nothing but a wonder which has too many marvelous things in its pockets which makes us
                    wonder how and where it all began.l Coming to the marvelous things in this world, have you ever
                    wondered how we invented a mode of communication to express our thoughts and feelings? Have you ever
                    thought about how the art of writing which is an integral part of our human life came into
                    existence? Imagine a world without language and writing. It’s difficult right. If not for this
                    writing, we wouldn’t be aware of our history and philosophy nor would we be enjoying the marvelous
                    works of Shakespeare or Byron. If not for the writing language we wouldn’t be aware of the previous
                    eras, and we would still be leaning on to the oral tradition which changes as it is passed. So,
                    language especially the written language is a cognitive method that is used to express an
                    individual’s thoughts and feelings. Early Roots The writing which is so important to human beings is
                    assumed to be the first important skill developed by us. The cave paintings which record the life of
                    humans become the earliest example to prove this fact. In fact, it is believed that the spoken
                    language has evolved tens and thousands of years earlier than the written language. Writing may have
                    been invented during three different times in three different parts of the world: in the Near East,
                    (roughly corresponded to the modern-day Middle East) China, and Mesoamerica. There are also several
                    places such as the Indus River valley and Rapa Nui (Easter Island) where writing may have been
                    invented but it remains undeciphered. Although these dates suggest that writing could have spread
                    out from one central point of origin, there is little evidence of any links between these systems,
                    with each possessing unique qualities. Of these three writing systems, only the Mesopotamian
                    cuneiform script, invented in Sumer, present-day Iraq, (c. 3200 BC), can be traced without any
                    discontinuity over a period of 10,000 years, from a prehistoric antecedent to the present-day
                    alphabet. </p>

                <p>A new social media platform based on voice messaging launched Monday.

                    Called Swell, free apps for the platform can be found in Apple's App Store and in Google Play.

                    According to the developers of Swell, it's the first social platform to focus exclusively on
                    asynchronous audio conversations, where audio clips up to five minutes in length can be posted to
                    the site.

                    Any Swell member can host a conversation and has control over who may participate in it, as well as
                    make posts.

                    Pictures and links can also be posted to conversations, but they must be accompanied with a voice
                    message.

                    Swell also provides its members a free swellcast.com Web page for sharing on social platforms and an
                    HTML widget for embedding conversations on websites. </p>
